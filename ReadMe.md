# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

> This project is based on a scenario where you work for a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe. Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources making it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team. In an effort to become more data-driven, your organisation would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location. Your first goal will be to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data. You will then query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

## Milestone 1

- Setup the environment in a GitHub Repo.

## Milestone 2

> Extract amd clean the data from the data sources.

- Task 1: Setup a new database to store the data. This is stored locally in the folder sales_data. The database is a postgres db.

- Task 2: Initialise the three project classes - Data_Extraction.py, Database_Utils.py and Data_Cleaning.py
